  Image-picker solves a problem I encountered when working with RAW files.
  
As you know RAW files are large files that need time to load before you can review them to decide if you want to edit them or not.

With this software you can just: 
1) preview the lighter JPEG or JPG files
2) put the files you want to edit in a folder
3) run the program and the respective RAW images will be transfered to the same folder automatically
